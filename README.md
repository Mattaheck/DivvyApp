Divvy savings app

1. Do a commit to your personal branch at least every working half hour.
2. Only push testing code to the dev branch. Master branch will be reserved for the final product.
3. Let each other know what you're working on to avoid conflicts.

Git Workflow
1. There is a `dev` branch that was branched off of `master`
2. Each developer has their own branch derived from `master`
3. A developer does work on their own branch
4. When developer wants to push changes, they'll run `git checkout dev`
5. Run `git pull origin dev` to get the latest changes from GitHub
6. Run `git merge [your_branch_name]` to merge your branch name into `dev`
7. Fix any merge conflicts
8. Do `git push origin dev` to push the new `dev` branch up
